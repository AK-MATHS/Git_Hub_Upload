Challenge 4 - Stack and Queue Challenge

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards or forwards.
Simple examples are:
madam
bob
toot
radar

An entire phrase can also be a palindrome, for example:
A Toyota's a toyota
A Santa at NASA
A man, aplan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a hat, a canal-Panama!

For the purposes of this assignment we will only consider alpha characters and ommit all other characters.
We will also not be considering case.
So,
A Santa at Nasa, will be processed as:
ASANTAATNASA

A common method to solve this problem is to compare the string to its reverse and 
if they are equal then it must be a palindrome. But we will use a deque.

I am providing the main driver for you which will automatically run several test cases.
Your challenge is to write the following function.
