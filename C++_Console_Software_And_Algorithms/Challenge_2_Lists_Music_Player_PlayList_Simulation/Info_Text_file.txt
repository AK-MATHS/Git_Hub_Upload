Lists and Forward_Lists
Using std::list

In this challenge, create a menu driven application that will similute a user playing songs from a playlist of songs.
 * 
 * 
 * Use a list to simulate the user selecting the first song in the playlist and
 * then selecting next and previous to play forward or backwards through the platlist.
 * 
 * 
 * Also, allow users to add new song to the playlist and 
 * they will be added prior to the currently playing song.




The menu looks as follows:


F - Play First Song
N - Play Next song
P - Play Previous song
A - Add and play a new song at current location
L - List the current playlist
========================================
Enter a selection (Q to quit): 

And the avaliable playlist is modeled as a std::list<Songs>
 * Song class. Following are the songs in the playlist.
 * Some Songs grabbed these from the pop charts, you can use 
 * 
 * 
 * God's Plan			Drake							5
 * Never Be The Same	Camila Cabello					5
 * Pray For Me			The Weekend and K. Lamar		4
 * The Middle			Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey		5
 * Wait					Maroone 5						4
 * Whatever It Takes	Imagine Dragons				3



Note:
 * For trouble reading input, use clear std::cin and 
 * ignore everything in the buffer with:
 * 
 * 
 * std::cin.clear();
 * std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(),'\n');
