# Finite element solution using C++

The solution to 1D elastostatics problem
Using the deal.II FEM library, here is a finite element code in C++ that solves a one dimensional elastostatic differential equation.
This FEM algorithm models the elemental nodes using linear, quadratic and cubic Lagrange Polynomial basis functions.
